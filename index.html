                <h2>Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beginning my education in Commercial Art, with a focus on Graphic Design, 
                        I have always wished to further my knowledge of computer based renderings 
                        and the programming required to make them possible. After a change of direction in my life, I 
                        persued a career in commercial construction, where I worked my way up the ladder from Laborer to Project Manager 
                        with the same company over an 18 year period. In 2021 our company had taken a major hit requiring me to 
                        journey out and accept another position with a more profitable business. I held the position as an Estimator/Project 
                        Manager for 2 years with this company but the working environment wasn't what I was lead to believe it would be.
                        I then decided to branch out to reconsider my career options and this is when I discovered the opportunity with Code:You. 
                        I jumped on board to persue my deeply rooted computer programming ambitions. 
                   </p>
                    <p>
                        Although my career experience has not been focused on computer programming, I have gained some extremely valuable
                        skills when it comes to Leadership, Teamwork, Communication, and Organization. When you review my resume, please 
                        consider my Dedication, Consistent Career Advancement, and Ambition to continually improve my knowledge and skills.

                    <p>
                        As an Estimator/ Project Manager with Mark Spaulding, I was responsible for researching material pricing,
                        landing projects through bidding, reviewing and creating contracts with clients and subcontractors, staging the project,
                        communicating project information with team members, holding weekly meetings with clients and subcontractors, procuring materials,
                        scheduling throughout the project duration, maintaining and recording the project budget, issuing and approving change orders, purchase orders,
                        and pay applications, and closing out the projects with the required closeout documents.

                    <p>
                        10/11/2024 - Current</p>
                    <p>After leaving Mark Spaulding, I decided to branch out to residential construction. Wishing to maintain my roll as Project Manager, 
                        I discovered The Finished Basement. The name speaks for itself! This company has offered the freedom I require as a self-sufficient 
                        leader while still working as a team to complete our projects. The crews are great and I feel much more like a member of a family 
                        than I did with my former employer. I accepted this position out of the necessity to pay the bills but, when I was accepted to join the Code:You
                        program, I decided to foloow my aspirations of leaving the construction world altogether.
